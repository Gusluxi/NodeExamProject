<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<div class="text-field">
    <p>This is a "create your own survey" application. 
        The idea is that you can signup and create surveys with 
        specific questions and share the survey with a hyperlink.
        The host of the survey will be able to view statistics of the answers. 
        Surveys will be secure and safe to share and answer.
