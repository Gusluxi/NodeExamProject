<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>This is a "create your own survey" application. The idea is that you can signup and create surveys with answers and then send a link to the survey to whoever you want.
    You will then be able to see some statistics for the answers. There is security in place so that you can only view and edit your own surveys and answers.
